# Multicraft-Waterfall-Paper
Multicraft Panel JAR Config Files for Diamond Dogs Network

# Minecraft 1.17.1

Config Files used to add Waterfall and PaperMC to the Multicraft Panel
Used in our network feel free to modify them as you see fit.

I released this here because I had a hard time finding them when I wanted to
add Waterfall and PaperMC to my multicraft panels drop down menus. I figured
others could use them as well, so I release them here.

I do not guarantee they are perfect but they work. If you find anything that
should be changed to improve them just do a pull request I will be happy to
accept changes that improve them.
